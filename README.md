# what-happened-here

My username has changed! Head over to https://github.com/drm2 for all of the repos you know and love!


## why the change?

In order to make my username a bit shorter and easier to relay to others, I've decided to go with the new handle of [@drm2](https://github.com/drm2)! I set this organization up to protect my old repository links, and GitHub will continue to forward them as long as I don't create a repo with the same name under this account. Happy Coding!
